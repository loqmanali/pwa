Create a web application that allows users to input any website URL, and it will convert it into a Progressive Web App (PWA). The app should generate a link for the PWA version of the website and display a QR code that, when scanned, redirects to the PWA. Ensure the app is responsive and generates the QR code dynamically.

Features:
Input Field: Let users input a URL for any website they want to convert to a PWA.

Generate PWA Link: After the URL is entered, generate a link that leads to the PWA version of the website.

Generate QR Code: Create a QR code for the generated PWA link so users can easily scan it using their mobile devices.

Responsive Design: Ensure the app works well on both desktop and mobile browsers.

Error Handling: If the user inputs an invalid URL, display an error message prompting them to enter a valid URL.
